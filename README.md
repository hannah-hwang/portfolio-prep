Software Developer

**2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?**

I am interested in creating user friendly websites that are fun and engaging.

**3. Your professional pitch:**

Hi, my name is Hannah and I am a software developer. During the day, I work as a pharmacy technician at an independent pharmacy where I have been working for three years. I came to the realization that in order to continue to support myself financially in the future, I needed to make a career change. I learned about software development through friends who are in the field, and after doing some reseach and learning a bit on my own, I decided to take the step into taking classes at Code Fellows. Since I’ve always loved putting things together and problem-solving, I’m excited to have found something I could enjoy and become passionate about. I plan on utilizing the skills I have learned in my past job experiences as well as the knowledge I have gained at Code Fellows to become a more well-equipped software developer.

**4. What excites you the most about tech?**

I love how there is always something new to learn about tech, and how creative you can be with tech.
